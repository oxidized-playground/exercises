#
# Welcome to the ALTEN rust playground. This exercise tries to create a minimal size binary for a hello world program in Rust
#
# To run this exercise you can run `cargo build` in this directory.
#
# Steps:
# Can you build a release version of this binary?
# Find flags to reduce the release binary in size. Add them to profile.release

version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

# Add flags to release profile for a minimal size build
# Tip: Can you optimize for size? Have Link Time Optimization? Remove debug information?
